# Audio Input Implementation

## Overview
The audio input screen now supports two modes:
1. **Record**: Record audio using the device microphone
2. **Upload**: Pick an audio file from local storage

Both modes use native Android transcription to convert audio to text, which is then displayed in the results screen.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Mode Selection
- Two tabs: "Record" and "Upload"
- Visual feedback showing which mode is active
- Easy switching between modes

### 2. Record Mode
- **Microphone Permission**: Automatically requests microphone access
- **Real-time Recording**: Records audio in M4A format (AAC-LC codec)
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows "Recording" indicator with red dot
- **Auto-transcription**: Automatically transcribes after stopping recording

### 3. Upload Mode
- **File Picker**: Opens native file picker for audio files
- **Storage Permission**: Requests storage access if needed
- **Supported Formats**: All audio formats supported by Android MediaPlayer
- **Auto-transcription**: Transcribes immediately after file selection

### 4. Transcription
- **Native Android Speech Recognition**: Uses Android's built-in SpeechRecognizer
- **Method Channel**: Flutter communicates with native Kotlin code
- **Progress Indicator**: Shows loading state during transcription
- **Confidence Score**: Displays transcription confidence percentage

### 5. UI Enhancements
- **Recording Indicator**: Live recording status with animated red dot
- **File Info**: Shows selected audio file name
- **Confidence Badge**: Green badge showing transcription confidence
- **Processing State**: Loading spinner during transcription

## Technical Implementation

### Flutter Side
- **Packages Added**:
  - `record: ^5.1.2` - Audio recording
  - `path_provider: ^2.1.5` - File path management
  - `file_picker: ^8.3.7` - File selection (already present)

- **Service Created**: `AudioTranscriptionService`
  - Method channel communication with native code
  - Error handling and result processing

### Native Android Side
- **MainActivity.kt**: Enhanced with method channel handler
  - `transcribeAudio` method: Accepts audio file path
  - SpeechRecognizer integration
  - MediaPlayer for audio playback during recognition
  - Comprehensive error handling

### Permissions
- `RECORD_AUDIO` - For microphone access
- `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - For file access
- `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` - For Android 13+ audio file access

## Usage Flow

### Record Flow:
1. User selects "Record" mode
2. Taps "Start Recording" button
3. App requests microphone permission (if needed)
4. Recording starts (red indicator shows)
5. User taps "Stop Recording"
6. Audio is saved to temporary directory
7. Native transcription begins automatically
8. Transcribed text appears in preview
9. User taps "Proceed" to view results

### Upload Flow:
1. User selects "Upload" mode
2. Taps "Pick Audio File" button
3. App requests storage permission (if needed)
4. File picker opens
5. User selects audio file
6. Native transcription begins automatically
7. Transcribed text appears in preview
8. User taps "Proceed" to view results

## Important Notes

### Limitations
- **Android SpeechRecognizer**: Designed for microphone input, not file transcription
- **Workaround**: Plays audio file while running speech recognition
- **Network Dependency**: May require internet connection for best results
- **Language**: Currently set to English (en-US)

### Production Recommendations
For production use, consider:
1. **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API**: Better accuracy for file transcription
2. **Offline Models**: Vosk, Whisper, or similar for offline transcription
3. **Multiple Languages**: Add language selection option
4. **Audio Format Conversion**: Convert various formats to optimal format

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
2. Build and run the app on Android device/emulator
3. Navigate to Audio Input screen
4. Test both Record and Upload modes
5. Verify transcription appears in results screen

## Error Handling
The implementation includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Permission denials
- Recording failures
- File not found errors
- Transcription errors
- Network issues
- Invalid audio formats

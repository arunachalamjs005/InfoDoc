   flutter doctor --android-licenses
   ```
   Press `y` to accept all licenses.

3. **Connect Device or Start Emulator**:
   - Physical device: Enable USB debugging
   - Or start Android emulator from Android Studio

## Running the App

### Step 1: Clean Build
```bash
cd c:\Users\ArunachalamJS\Documents\G_Hackthon\Code_base\InfoDoc\infodoc_app
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### Step 2: Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```

Or use VS Code:
- Press `F5` or click "Run → Start Debugging"

## Testing OCR Functionality

### Test 1: Camera OCR ✅

**Steps:**
1. Launch the app
2. Tap the central **"+"** button (blue floating button)
3. Select **"Camera"** option (green icon)
4. Allow camera permission when prompted
5. Point camera at text (book, document, sign, etc.)
6. Capture the image
7. **Verify**: Preview shows the captured image (not placeholder)
8. Tap **"Proceed"** button
9. **Watch**: Loading screen shows OCR progress:
   - "Initializing OCR..."
   - "Extracting text from image..."
   - "Processing image..."
   - "Text extraction complete!"
10. **Verify**: Results screen displays extracted text in the **Claim** section

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Real captured image appears in preview
- ✅ OCR extracts text from image
- ✅ Extracted text shows in Results → Claim widget
- ✅ Source shows "InfoDoc OCR" with 📄 icon

### Test 2: Upload OCR ✅

**Steps:**
1. Launch the app
2. Tap the central **"+"** button
3. Select **"Upload"** option (purple icon)
4. Allow storage permission when prompted
5. Select an image with text from gallery
6. **Verify**: Preview shows the selected image (not placeholder)
7. Tap **"Proceed"** button
8. **Watch**: Loading screen shows OCR progress
9. **Verify**: Results screen displays extracted text in the **Claim** section

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Real uploaded image appears in preview
- ✅ OCR extracts text from image
- ✅ Extracted text shows in Results → Claim widget

### Test 3: Image Without Text

**Steps:**
1. Upload/capture an image with NO text (e.g., landscape photo)
2. Proceed to verification
3. **Verify**: Results show "No text detected in the image."

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ App handles gracefully
- ✅ Shows appropriate message

### Test 4: Error Handling

**Steps:**
1. Try with very low-quality/blurry image
2. **Verify**: App doesn't crash
3. Shows extracted text (may be inaccurate) or error message

## Sample Test Images

### Good Test Images (High OCR Accuracy):
- 📄 Printed documents
- 📖 Book pages
- 🪧 Signs with clear text
- 📰 Newspaper articles
- 💳 Business cards
- 🏷️ Product labels

### Poor Test Images (Low OCR Accuracy):
- 🌆 Landscape photos without text
- 😊 Selfies/portraits
- 🎨 Abstract art
- 📱 Screenshots with small text
- 🌃 Low-light images

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Building with plugins requires symlink support"
**Solution:**
```powershell
start ms-settings:developers
```
Enable Developer Mode in Windows Settings.

### Issue: App crashes on camera/upload
**Solution:**
1. Check permissions are granted in device settings
2. Verify `AndroidManifest.xml` has all permissions
3. Restart the app

### Issue: "No text detected" for images with text
**Solution:**
- Use high-quality images
- Ensure good lighting
- Text should be horizontal
- Use standard fonts (not handwritten)

### Issue: OCR takes too long
**Solution:**
- Use smaller images (< 5MB)
- Ensure good device performance
- Wait patiently (can take 3-10 seconds)

### Issue: Inaccurate text extraction
**Solution:**
- Improve image quality
- Better lighting
- Clearer text
- Standard fonts work best

## Verification Checklist

After running the app, verify:

- [ ] App launches without errors
- [ ] Camera button opens camera
- [ ] Upload button opens file picker
- [ ] Preview shows ACTUAL images (not placeholders)
- [ ] "Proceed" button triggers OCR
- [ ] Loading screen shows progress messages
- [ ] Results screen displays extracted text
- [ ] "Claim" widget contains the OCR text
- [ ] Source shows "InfoDoc OCR 📄"
- [ ] No crashes during the flow

## Performance Expectations

| Metric | Expected Value |
|--------|---------------|
| OCR Processing Time | 2-10 seconds |
| Image Size Limit | < 10MB recommended |
| Text Detection Rate | 80-95% for clear text |
| Supported Languages | English (eng) |
| Supported Formats | JPG, PNG, BMP |

## Next Steps After Testing

### If Everything Works ✅
1. Test with various image types
2. Test edge cases (rotated text, multiple languages)
3. Consider adding image preprocessing
4. Add text editing capability
5. Implement result saving/sharing

### If Issues Found ❌
1. Check console logs for errors
2. Verify all permissions granted
3. Test with different images
4. Check device compatibility
5. Review error messages

## Advanced Features to Add

1. **Image Preprocessing**:
   - Auto-rotate images
   - Enhance contrast
   - Remove noise

2. **Multi-language Support**:
   ```dart
   language: 'eng+hin+tam' // English + Hindi + Tamil
   ```

3. **Text Editing**:
   - Allow users to edit extracted text
   - Copy to clipboard
   - Share extracted text

4. **History**:
   - Save OCR results
   - View past extractions
   - Re-verify saved results

5. **Batch Processing**:
   - Process multiple images
   - Combine text from multiple sources
